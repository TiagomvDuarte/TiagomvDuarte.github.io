Explanation

Understanding the problem
This error message "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()" indicates that a resource (like an image, script, stylesheet, or other file) that the web page is trying to load could not be found on the server. The 404 status code specifically means "Not Found," which is a standard HTTP response indicating that the requested resource does not exist at the specified URL on the server.

How to verify
Identify the failing resource: In the Chrome DevTools Console, click on the red error message. This should take you to the "Network" tab where you can see more details about the failed request. The "Name" column will show you the name of the resource that failed to load and the "Initiator" column will indicate which part of the code initiated the loading of the resource.
Inspect the URL: Examine the "Name" column, and in particular, the URL of the requested resource. Verify if the URL is correct and if the file it points to is where it's expected to be on the server.
Check the server: If you have access to the server, check if the file exists in the specified location.
Suggested fix
Correct the file path: If the file exists but the path in your code is incorrect, update the file path to match the actual location of the file on the server. This is done where the resource is linked or requested in the code. For example, if you have an image:
Code

<!-- Old incorrect path -->
    <img src="images/my_image.jpg" alt="My Image">
    
    <!-- New correct path -->
    <img src="assets/images/my_image.jpg" alt="My Image">
Use code snippets with caution

Upload the missing file: If the file does not exist on the server, upload it to the correct location. Once uploaded, try reloading the page to see if the error has been resolved.
Check for Typos: Carefully review the resourceâ€™s path for any typos. A simple misspelling can easily cause a 404 error.
Summary
The "404 Not Found" error means a requested resource cannot be found at the URL specified in the code. The most common causes are incorrect file paths in the code or missing files on the server. Verify the file path and the file's existence to fix the problem.
