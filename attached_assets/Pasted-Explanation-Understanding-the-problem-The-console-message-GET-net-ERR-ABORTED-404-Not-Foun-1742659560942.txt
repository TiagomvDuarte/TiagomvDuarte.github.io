Explanation

Understanding the problem
The console message GET ... net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found) indicates that the browser tried to fetch a CSS file located at https://git-flow-builder-tiagomiguelduar.replit.app/TiagomvDuarte.github.io/assets/index-B2qJTDmU.css, but the server responded with a 404 error, meaning the file was not found at that location.

The request details show that:

The browser requested a CSS file.
The request originated from https://git-flow-builder-tiagomiguelduar.replit.app/.
The server returned a 404 status code.
This usually happens when the path to the CSS file is incorrect in your HTML or JavaScript code, or when the CSS file was not uploaded to the server in the expected path.

How to verify
Check the path: Verify if the file index-B2qJTDmU.css exists inside the TiagomvDuarte.github.io/assets/ folder in your project's file system on the server.
Inspect HTML: Check your HTML code for a <link> tag that is referencing this CSS file, or any JavaScript code dynamically appending this CSS file to the DOM. Verify that the href attribute in the <link> tag correctly points to the file.
Check the network tab: Use the Network tab in Chrome DevTools to confirm the exact URL being requested and the server's response.
Suggested fix
Correct the path: Check your HTML file where you link the CSS file. If you are using a relative path, ensure it's correct from the HTML file's location. If you are using an absolute path, double-check that the path is correct.
Code

<!-- Original incorrect path -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/TiagomvDuarte.github.io/assets/index-B2qJTDmU.css">
    
    <!-- Corrected path assuming that the CSS file is at the root of the web project. -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/index-B2qJTDmU.css">

    <!-- Corrected path assuming that you deployed the files in the folder TiagomvDuarte.github.io -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/index-B2qJTDmU.css">
Use code snippets with caution

Upload the CSS file: Ensure the CSS file index-B2qJTDmU.css is present inside your assets folder in the TiagomvDuarte.github.io directory. Re-upload or re-deploy the file if it was missing.
Verify File Name: Make sure that the name index-B2qJTDmU.css does not contain any typos, and that the case of the file name matches.
Summary
The browser is unable to find the CSS file because the URL specified in your code does not exist on the server. This can be due to an incorrect path in the <link> tag, an incorrectly uploaded file, or a mix up on the file name. Ensure the path and the filename match the actual location and name of the file on the server. If the files are stored in a specific directory, make sure the path in the href attribute reflects that.
